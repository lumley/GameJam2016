# The Ancient Evil

This is a very basic game done during the [Global Game Jam][ggj] 2016 in [InnoGames][inno] (Hamburg) 
 - The game in Global Game Jam site is [here][ggj-game]
 - The game in InnoGames site is [here][inno-game]

## Introduction
Once upon a time the Ancient Evil had awaken. 7 brave Grand Mages managed to perform the Ritual to send him to Abyss. But Ancient Evil may escape with a help of followers. 4 heroes tries to perform a counter-ritual to summon the cruel Ancient Evil. Whoever be the first to collect secret ingredients, wins the game.

## How to play
 - Each player will spawn in a corner (from now on, called _base_)
 - Each _base_ requires certain elements drawn in red
 - Elements will spawn at the middle of the screen one at a time, randomly
 - Players will pick elements by just walking over them
 - Drop the required items in your _base_ to win
 - Touching lava will kill you
 - Staying too long in an enemy _base_ or the middle region will kill you

### Controls
#### Controller (XBOX360)
 - Use DPad to move
 - A to attack
 - B to drop item

#### Keyboard
It is not recommended to play with keyboard, but if there is no other choice, here it is. Only players 1 and 2 can play with keyboard.
##### player 1
 - a, s, d, w to move
 - c to attack
 - v to drop item

##### player 2
 - left, down, right, up to move
 - n to attack
 - m to drop item

## Known issues
 - Keyboard control is pretty awkward, would recommend to use only Controllers
 - In order for the object dropped to be counted in your _base_, the player owner from the base needs to drop it

## Contributions
This repository does not accept contributions or pull requets. Its aim is to keep the project in the same state as it was when the GameJam was finished. Feel free to fork it and continue its development, though!
